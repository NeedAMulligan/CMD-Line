Find large files on your system

forfiles /S /M *.* /C "cmd /c if @fsize gtr 1073741824 echo @path"


Let me break down the command for you:

forfiles is a Windows command to take actions on files in a folder
/S instructs the forfiles to also check the subdirectories
/M specifies the search pattern. The *.* instructs to check for all names and extensions
/C "cmd /c if @fsize gtr 1073741824 echo @path": This specifies the command to be executed on each file that matches the search criteria. Here's the breakdown of this sub-command:
cmd /c: Executes the command string that follows it.
if @fsize gtr 1073741824: Checks the size of the file (@fsize) and compares it to 1,073,741,824 bytes (1 GB). gtr stands for "greater than." If the file size is greater than 1 GB, the command inside the if condition will execute.
echo @path: Outputs (displays) the full path of the file that satisfies the condition.
